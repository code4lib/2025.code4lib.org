    databases, data structures--can reinforce existing social inequality, and, crucially, how we can
    use data infrastructures to guide us towards the worlds we wish to build. As a software
    engineer, led the architecture of web properties for billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola,
    Sony, and Instagram, and their work won numerous awards, including at SXSW. As a community
    organizer, Stevens's work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award and

    at MIT where they are writing *Abolitionist Engineering,* a book about data infrastructure,
    software engineering, and the contemporary prison abolition movement."
